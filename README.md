# Basic-Landing-Page
This is the first real project i did , although i watch a youtube tutorial for it, but i understood 80% of what was being done.
pretty good for a person who learned html and css in like 2 hours maybe.
Well, i learn by practicing and copyting shit from others.
so yeah, i will keep copying stuffs untill i fully understand everything
did the same while learning photoshop , and now i can create almost anything that you want me to create.
wanna do the same with frint end and then later move on to backend.
